## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: 5-phase structure adopted from research Build Order (Foundations → Coach+Admin → Finder+Routing → Reply → Hardening); risk gradient Coach→Finder→Reply drives pillar order.
- [Roadmap]: Multilingual + audit logging baked into Phase 1 (retrofitting forces index rebuild / PDPA-vulnerable backfill).
- [Phase 1]: Three required spikes (SPIKE-RAG, SPIKE-DEPLOY, SPIKE-CRON) gate all downstream work — must resolve before Phase 2.

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

Carried from research — must be held during Phase 1 planning:

- Firestore region final pick (`asia-southeast1` vs `asia-southeast2`) is immovable once set — resolve with Derek before project creation.
- Anthropic has no Asian residency (May 2026); TIA + pseudonymization is the v1 path, Bedrock-Singapore the fallback — decide in Phase 1.
- Voyage BM/Mandarin embedding quality unverified — gated by SPIKE-RAG.
- Standardize embedding dimension on 1024-d in Phase 1; pin one model per collection.
